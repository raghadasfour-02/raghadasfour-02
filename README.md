### Hello ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Raghad.

Systems Design Engineering student. Programming enthusiast
*I like to code.*
I like to build applications using different languages. Iâ€™m fluent in Python, C++, Javascript, React, and recently started to learn Go.

*I like to read books about software.*
I have read Agile Software development by Robert C.Martin, Clean Code by Robert C.Martin, and The Pragmatic Programmer by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas. On my TRL: Test Driven Development by Kent Beck. 

Bonus: I like cats, I read philosophy books, and I find the universe pretty darn cool.
